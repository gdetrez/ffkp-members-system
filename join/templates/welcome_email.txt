Welcome to the FFKP!
 
We're delighted that you've joined as a member, and wanted to take this opportunity to highlight some of our activities and what will happen next with your membership registration.
 
* What's happening in the FFKP?
 
First of all, we have regular membership activities and meetings. Please keep an eye out for them in the newsletter (see below) to see when and where we meet!
Second of all, the most important activity for us right now is the upcoming conference FSCONS. Please check http://wiki.fscons.org/page/FSCONS_2012_Planning for more information.
 
* What happens now?
 
As a new member you will be automatically subscribed to our newsletter. Our newsletter is monthly edited feature of the news that also appears on our web site. Please let us know if you don't want to be subscribed to the newsletter, and we'll be sure not to include you! You also have the option of being subscribed to our internal mailing list for members, people@ffkp.se, but as this is a more high-intensive discussion list sometimes with mails every day, we don't subscribe you to it by default. Instead, you can contact us if you wish to be subscribed, either by simply replying to this email, or writing separately to info@ffkp.se.
 
Again, welcome as a member, and we hope to see you soon at one of our activities!
